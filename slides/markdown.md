## Proposition:
Bitcoin *is* interesting, altcoins are *not*

---

### Argument 1: Bitcoin is interesting
- Money as a technology is over 75,000 years old
- Essential for human cooperation & specialisation
- Changes in monetary tech are rare, but result in societal change
- Bitcoin represents **_separation of money and state_**


--

- Consequences of apolitical money are huge:
  - Hierarchical `$\rightarrow$` Horizontal
  - Central banks `$\rightarrow$` Open p2p network
- Bitcoin is [superior monetary technology](https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)
- People *will* use it for international trade & against inflation, capital controls and currency collapse
- Global, intergenerational effects if successful
- `$\implies$` Bitcoin is *interesting*

---

#### Argument 2: *If* altcoins are interesting, they're *much* less interesting
- No altcoin seriously attempts separation of money and state
- Instead, alts aim at FinTech, DeFi, NFTs, etc.
- These are niche applications in comparison to global, sound money
- Marginal benefits, not intergenerational effects
- `$\implies$` If alts are at all interesting, they're *far* less so than Bitcoin

---

#### Argument 3: New tokens *aren't* interesting
- Money relies on a *network effect*
- `$\implies$` the market will choose **_one_**
- Control over the money supply brings huge power
- `$\implies$` If control is possible, it will be taken
- `$\implies$` Decentralisation *matters*
- Consensus without central authority is the *entire purpose* of (the) blockchain
- Altcoins are *de facto* centralised `$\Rightarrow$` *not* interesting

#### Blockchain innovation does not require a new token for each experiment
- Lightning network:
  - unlimited throughput
  - instant micropayments
- Bitcoin sidechains:
  - RSK for smart contracts (emulates EVM)
  - Liquid
  - Drivechain BIP300/301
- Taproot, Schnorr

#### Evidence: Markets have chosen
- Bitcoin is the [best performing asset](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-31/bitcoin-s-9-000-000-rise-this-decade-leaves-the-skeptics-aghast) in history
- [Corporate treasury](https://bitcointreasuries.org/) adoption
- Bitcoin derivatives and [ETFs](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/worlds-first-bitcoin-etf-soars-past-500-million-in-assets-under-management-213407975.html)
- Price of [BTC vs forks](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin-cash/btc) trends to `$\infty$`
- Major central banks and IMF, [BIS](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bank-chief-scathing-over-bitcoin-use-mqk97vk3l) are *worried*
